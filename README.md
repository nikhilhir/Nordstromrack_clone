# Nordstromrack_clone
The website to be cloned was Nordstrom rack.com, a US-based e-commerce website .where users can purchase clothes, accessories, household, and lifestyle products. As part of my project, I had to replicate the landing page, login/sign up, and the product pages, along with the ability to wish list an item, add an item to the cart, and checkout using a coupon code.

Sign-in and sign-up pages
Landing page, product list, and individual product pages
Shopping bag and checkout pages
I faced challenges :

Iâ€™ll start from 1st day, my 1st day is gone just mapping layout search detail about how to original made. The challenge was to ensure that the Javascript, DOM part worked properly or not
